TODO

try incorporating a 200 period sma/ema to the entry conditions

change the volatility condition so that volatility is measured at the moment 
the trade entry is triggered, not at the start of the test period

rewrite the minimum price condition so it's based on volatility, that way it 
will be equally effective on all timeframes (lower vol requires higher min price)

re-test all the other strats i wrote now that profit is being calculated properly

code up all the entry / exit conditions on google keep and test them

code up a sortino / sqn metric for optimising

try optimising rsi lookback length (maybe 3, 4, 6, 9, 14)

try optimising the supertrend inputs (10, 3)

get pnl evolution plotted on the single test plot

incorporate get_historical_klines into get_data so i can do longer tests if needed
