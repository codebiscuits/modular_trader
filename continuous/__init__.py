# this is a new system inspired by the 'advanced futures trading strategies' book, uusing a continuous trading paradigm
# instead of discrete setups and positions.

# i want to run the system on woo, so i will develop functions for execution and monitoring of the woo exchange, and i
# want all functionality of this system and the other parts of modular_trader to be interoperable and also stand-alone
# systems.

# it might be worth starting this system using polars instead of pandas for dataframes, so i don't have to migrate later,
# and once i'm more familiar with polars, it will make migrating the rest of modular trader easier.
